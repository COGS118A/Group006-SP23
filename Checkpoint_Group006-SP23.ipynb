    "- This project aims to address the limited understanding of predictors associated with in-hospital mortality among admitted patients. The goal is to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality in order to improve patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use Logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest to develop the prediction model, taking into account various potential predictors. By considering a wide range of factors such as patient demographics, medical history, severity of illness, and treatment interventions, the study aims to capture the complex interplay of variables that contribute to patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will split the data into training set, validation set and test set and get the confusion matrix to estimate the power, accuracy of our model. By establishing a robust prediction model, this project seeks to provide healthcare professionals with a valuable tool for identifying patients at higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Such a model can aid in clinical decision-making, resource allocation, and optimizing care strategies to improve patient outcomes."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Substantial researches have demonstrated significant associations between demographic characteristics, vital signs, comorbidities, laboratory variables, and clinical outcomes of ICU patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact of demographic characteristics: Previous studies have found that demographic characteristics such as age, gender, race, weight, and height can have a significant impact on patients' health status and clinical outcomes<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote).Age is an important predictive factor, with increasing age being associated with higher disease incidence and mortality rates. Gender and race may also play a role in disease development and outcomes. Weight and height can be associated with conditions like obesity and underweight, which may affect patients' vital signs and disease progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of vital signs: Vital signs are crucial indicators for assessing patients' physiological status and health condition. Measures such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation reflect the cardiovascular function, respiratory function, and temperature regulation of patients. Previous research has shown an association between abnormal vital signs and adverse clinical outcomes, including the in-hospital mortality rate <a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote).\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Impact of comorbidities on clinical outcomes: Comorbidities refer to the simultaneous presence of other diseases or pathological conditions in patients. Comorbidities such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, depression, iron-deficiency anemia, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) play a significant role in patients' health status and disease prognosis. Previous studies have found that these comorbidities may increase the risk of in-hospital mortality<a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#admonishnote)\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive ability of laboratory variables: Laboratory variables include blood indicators, urine indicators, and other biochemical markers such as red blood cell count, platelet count, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, blood glucose level, and electrolyte concentrations. Previous research has shown that these laboratory variables are associated with patients' health status and disease prognosis and can be used to predict clinical outcomes, including the in-hospital mortality rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating and further analyzing the findings from previous research, this study aims to delve into the relationship between demographic characteristics, vital signs, comorbidities, laboratory variables, and the in-hospital mortality rate. The goal is to provide more accurate prediction models and information for enhancing clinical decision-making and patient management."

It contains continuous variables, i.e. age, BMI, heart rate .etc. Also, there are categorical variables, such as gender, ventilated apache, elective surgery .etc(some medical indicators). Some of the remarkable variables are age, BMI, gender, the APACHE II diagnosis for the ICU admission, and we will work out the most critical variables in subsequent studies.\n",

    "- Data preprocessing is an essential step in preparing raw data for analysis and modeling. Before apply our models, we will perform data cleaning and data transformation, also handle outliers. Basically, we will identify and handle missing data by either removing the incomplete entries or imputing values based on statistical techniques, and remove duplicate records to avoid bias in the analysis. Then normalize or standardize the data to bring all variables to a similar scale, eliminating any bias caused by the differences in their ranges if needed. Also, we will use one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables. Finally, we will Detect and handle outliers that may significantly impact the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **We made some changes to the proposal since we notice that the dataset is imbalanced, so we apply random under-sampling. It is employed in situations where the majority class overwhelms the minority class. By randomly removing instances from the majority class, random under-sampling aims to create a balanced dataset with a reduced number of instances from the majority class. This technique helps prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class and allows the minority class to be adequately represented during model training. Random under-sampling is typically used when the dataset is large enough to ensure that removing instances from the majority class will not result in a significant loss of valuable information. Also, the model we choose(Logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest) are Imbalance-Insensitive Models.**\n"

    "- Model Development: \n",
    "1. The reason why we use logistic regression is that the outcome of patients is binary, and when the dependent variable is a binary variable, logistic regression is commonly used to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables.\n",
    "2. The reason why we use decision tree is that one of the advantages of decision trees is their ability to capture complex non-linear relationships between independent variables and the binary outcome. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical variables, making them flexible for various types of data.\n",
    "3. The reason why we use random forest is that Random forest overcomes some limitations of individual decision trees, such as overfitting and high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Validation and Evaluation: The validation set will be used to assess the performance of the developed prediction model. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The confusion matrix will also be computed to estimate the power and accuracy of the model.\n",
