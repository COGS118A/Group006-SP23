    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Substantial researches have demonstrated significant associations between demographic characteristics, vital signs, comorbidities, laboratory variables, and clinical outcomes of ICU patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact of demographic characteristics: Previous studies have found that demographic characteristics such as age, gender, race, weight, and height can have a significant impact on patients' health status and clinical outcomes<a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote).Age is an important predictive factor, with increasing age being associated with higher disease incidence and mortality rates. Gender and race may also play a role in disease development and outcomes. Weight and height can be associated with conditions like obesity and underweight, which may affect patients' vital signs and disease progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of vital signs: Vital signs are crucial indicators for assessing patients' physiological status and health condition. Measures such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation reflect the cardiovascular function, respiratory function, and temperature regulation of patients. Previous research has shown an association between abnormal vital signs and adverse clinical outcomes, including the in-hospital mortality rate <a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote).\n ",
    "\n",
    "Impact of comorbidities on clinical outcomes: Comorbidities refer to the simultaneous presence of other diseases or pathological conditions in patients. Comorbidities such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, depression, iron-deficiency anemia, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) play a significant role in patients' health status and disease prognosis. Previous studies have found that these comorbidities may increase the risk of in-hospital mortality<a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#admonishnote)",
    "\n",
    "Predictive ability of laboratory variables: Laboratory variables include blood indicators, urine indicators, and other biochemical markers such as red blood cell count, platelet count, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, blood glucose level, and electrolyte concentrations. Previous research has shown that these laboratory variables are associated with patients' health status and disease prognosis and can be used to predict clinical outcomes, including the in-hospital mortality rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating and further analyzing the findings from previous research, this study aims to delve into the relationship between demographic characteristics, vital signs, comorbidities, laboratory variables, and the in-hospital mortality rate. The goal is to provide more accurate prediction models and information for enhancing clinical decision-making and patient management.\n"
